# Code of Conduct

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

To foster a positive environment, all community members are expected to follow these standards:

- **Demonstrate empathy and kindness** toward others.
- **Respect differing opinions**, viewpoints, and experiences.
- **Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback.**
- **Accept responsibility and apologize** to those affected by our mistakes, learning from the experience.
- **Focus on what is best for the overall community**, not just individual interests.

### Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

- Using sexualized language or imagery, or making sexual advances of any kind.
- Engaging in trolling, making insulting or derogatory comments, or personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment of any kind.
- Publishing others' private information (e.g., physical addresses or email addresses) without their explicit permission.
- Conduct that could be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all community spaces, including when individuals are officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representation include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events.

## Enforcement
